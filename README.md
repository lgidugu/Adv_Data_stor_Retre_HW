# Adv_Data_stor_Retre_HW
In this assignmnet the temparature, precipitation and the stations it was recorded was analyzed using Jupyter notebook, Flask, SQlite dabase was created and finally were plots were to demonstrate the trends
Using Jupyter Notebook, Data from CSV file read and cleaned, exported cleaned CSV file. SQlite was created with two tables were created and used for analysis. The climate analysis plots included precipitation Vs. temparature from the latest data on Honolulu, Hawaii Station. A histogram was plotted to demonstrate the highest temparatures at Honolulu station. Finally an average temparature bar graph with an error bar was plotted. 
In the end, using Flask, following routes were created.
Precipatations data
List of stations
List of totla temparatures observed in a year date range
Average, Minimum and Maximun temparatures in a partcular date range and finally,
Average, Minimum and Maximum temparatures for a particular date.
